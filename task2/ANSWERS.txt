Firstly, if the missing semester was posted, for example, during winter break,
I would have found some time from the rather long winter break. Since it wasn't 
until the term started when we started getting busy, I didn't get the chance to
look at the missing semester content. 

Secondly, I felt like I missed the announcement about the missing semester course 
whether it was in lecture or on piazza, so perhaps a canvas message/notification
or Piazza "forced post" would be useful in letting me know. Many students disable
Piazza notifications, and don't check piazza until they have questions because an 
email every 4 hours with irrelevant questions is annoying, and many people see piazza
as a Q&A place rather than a place with course information so I think you could have 
used the "forced post" feature on important information such as this. 

For example, I took an optional C++ basics 5-hour course at the start of CPSC 221,
which really helped with the labs in that course. Since it was mentioned several times
in lecture, and it was a module on canvas that I could see every time I went there,
along with a "forced" announcement with an email, so I knew about the course and
watched the videos. 

This is my personal preference, but assignments/content could be posted on canvas 
instead since many people use the canvas to-do list to track things to do, and
adding some due-date (for finishing the course, not for points) would give me 
some extra motivation.
